## Early Development Warning
While nearly feature complete, this mod is still in very early development - I haven't even tested it in multiplayer yet. Expect many bugs and/or gamebreaking issues.

## Introduction
The AN/PEQ-25 Weapon Mounted Laser Designator is a near-future (fictional) successor to the AN/PEQ-15 IR laser pointer. The AN/PEQ-25 adds a secondary emitter capable of designating targets for aircraft equipped with laser guided munitions.

## Usage
- Equip the AN/PEQ-25 via arsenal or another method
- Select the weapon on which the designator is mounted
- Arm the designator via either the included CBA keybind (default: Alt + L) or ACE interaction equipment menu
- To fire the laser, hold the key which you use to toggle your laser pointer (Common > Headlights On/Off)
- While firing, the IR laser and a UI indicator will blink rapidly

NOTE: While armed, the designator and IR laser are momentary (will only fire while holding down the laser key) and linked. Once disarmed, normal IR laser operation is resumed.

The designator is mountable on all weapons which can use the vanilla IR laser pointer, including mod weapons, no compatibility patch needed.

Any side should be able to use the item and the script will spawn the correct side laser target.
